### Breaking Changes

To indicate a breaking change, add `!` after the type/scope and include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

## üß™ Testing

Before submitting your changes:

1. **Run all tests**: `./run_tests.sh`
2. **Ensure 100% pass rate**: All tests must pass
3. **Add tests for new features**: New functionality should include tests
4. **Update existing tests**: If you change existing behavior, update relevant tests

## üìö Code Style

- Follow C# coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Use consistent formatting (let your editor handle this)
