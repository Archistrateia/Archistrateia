## Version History

- **1.0.0** - Complete movement system modernization with Godot integration
- **0.1.0** - Initial release with core game systems

---

## Migration Guide

### From 0.1.0 to 1.0.0

The refactoring from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0 represents a complete modernization of the movement and rendering systems. All existing functionality has been preserved while significantly improving performance and maintainability.

#### Breaking Changes
- None - All existing APIs and functionality maintained

#### Performance Improvements
- **Pathfinding**: 2-3x faster with Godot's AStar2D
- **Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated with Godot's native systems
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced through elimination of duplicate code

#### New Capabilities
- **Smooth Animations**: Hardware-accelerated movement transitions
- **Better Performance**: Optimized pathfinding and rendering
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Cleaner, more organized codebase
