A strategic war simulation game built with Godot Engine and C#.

> **ðŸŽ‰ Version 1.0.0 Released!** Complete movement system modernization with Godot integration.

## Overview

Archistrateia is a turn-based strategic war simulation that focuses on tactical decision-making and resource management in military conflicts. Players command ancient Egyptian armies, managing units, cities, and resources across diverse terrain.

## Features

### Core Game Systems
- **Turn-based gameplay** with 4 distinct phases: Earn, Purchase, Move, Combat
- **Unit management** with 4 unique unit types: Nakhtu, Medjay, Archer, Charioteer
- **Resource system** using gold/drachma for unit purchasing and city management
- **Terrain system** with 5 terrain types affecting movement and combat
- **City management** with production values and ownership mechanics

### Unit Types
- **Nakhtu** (3 Attack, 2 Defense, 2 Movement) - Basic infantry
- **Medjay** (4 Attack, 3 Defense, 3 Movement) - Elite guards
- **Archer** (5 Attack, 1 Defense, 2 Movement) - Ranged units
- **Charioteer** (6 Attack, 2 Defense, 4 Movement) - Fast cavalry

### Terrain Types
- **Desert** - High movement cost, no defense bonus
- **Hill** - High movement cost, +2 defense bonus
- **River** - Very high movement cost, +1 defense bonus
- **Shoreline** - Low movement cost, no defense bonus
- **Lagoon** - Highest movement cost, no defense bonus

## Development Status

âœ… **Core Systems Implemented** - All basic game mechanics are functional
- Turn management system
- Unit creation and management
- Player resource system
- City production mechanics
- Terrain system with movement costs
- Basic game state management

âœ… **Movement System Modernized** - Complete Godot integration
- Godot-native pathfinding with AStar2D
- Hardware-accelerated animations
- Modern visual rendering system
- Comprehensive test coverage

ðŸš§ **Next Steps** - UI integration and gameplay expansion
- Visual representation of units and terrain
- User interface for turn management
- Combat resolution system
- Map generation and visualization
- Multiplayer support

## Game Mechanics

### Turn Structure
1. **Earn Phase** - Players receive gold from owned cities
2. **Purchase Phase** - Players buy new units with available gold
3. **Move Phase** - Players move units across the map
4. **Combat Phase** - Units engage in combat (system to be expanded)

### Resource Management
- Cities generate gold each turn based on their production value
- Units have specific costs and must be purchased during the purchase phase
- Movement is limited by terrain costs and unit movement points

### Strategic Elements
- Terrain affects both movement and combat effectiveness
- Cities provide defensive bonuses and economic benefits
- Unit variety creates tactical depth and strategic choices
